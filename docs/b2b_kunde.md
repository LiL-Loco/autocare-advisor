**D → Smart Market Questions**

- **What keeps them awake at night:** Watching conversion rates decline month over month despite increased traffic, knowing that every lost customer represents failed revenue and questioning if he's missing something obvious that competitors are doing better
- **What are they secretly afraid of:** Being replaced by someone younger with better technical skills, or that his boss will lose confidence in his ability to drive online growth and hire external consultants

- **Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:** 1) High return rates due to customers choosing wrong products, 2) Spending hours analyzing why customers leave without purchasing, 3) Pressure from management to improve metrics with limited budget and resources
- **Biggest secret desire in life:** To be recognized as the e-commerce expert who transformed their company's online presence and became a case study other professionals learn from
- **Built-in bias to how they make decisions:** Relies heavily on data and testing, but tends to overthink and delay decisions when data is inconclusive; prefers proven solutions over experimental approaches
- **Common words or language unique to them:** "Conversion funnel," "bounce rate," "customer journey," "ROI," "A/B testing," "user experience optimization," "abandoned cart recovery"
- **Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:** 1) Most tools are too generic and don't understand automotive customer behavior, 2) Solutions require too much technical implementation time, 3) Expensive enterprise tools with features they don't need

**F → Purchasing Habits**

- **Top 3 Decision Triggers:** 1) Clear ROI demonstration with specific metrics, 2) Case studies from similar companies showing proven results, 3) Free trial or pilot program that allows testing before full commitment
- **Prior Purchases For This Pain:** Previously tried generic recommendation engines (failed), hired conversion optimization consultants (mixed results), purchased various analytics tools, attempted to build internal solution (abandoned)
- **Price Tolerance For Offer:** €300-800 monthly budget allocated for conversion optimization tools, with potential to justify higher costs if ROI is proven
- **Time Horizon Of Solution:** Expects to see initial improvements within 30-60 days, with significant results within 6 months

**G → Primary Wants**

**H → Empathy Map**

- **Seeing:** Google Analytics showing declining conversion rates, customer service emails about wrong product purchases, competitors' websites that seem to guide customers better, management presentations requesting improved performance
- **Thinking:** "There has to be a better way to help customers find the right products," "Why do customers spend so much time browsing but not buying?" "Am I missing something obvious that would solve this?" "How do I prove ROI on optimization investments?"
- **Hearing:** Management pressure about improving online performance, customer complaints about product complexity, colleagues discussing successful competitor strategies, industry experts talking about personalization and customer experience
- **Feeling:** Frustrated by current performance, anxious about meeting targets, overwhelmed by the complexity of optimization options, hopeful that the right solution exists, determined to find something that works
- **Saying:** "Our conversion rate should be higher with this traffic quality," "Customers are getting confused by our product range," "We need better product guidance," "I need to find a solution that actually works"
- **Doing:** Analyzing website metrics daily, researching optimization tools, attending webinars about e-commerce improvement, testing different approaches, comparing competitor websites, calculating potential ROI of various solutions

Marcus represents the Problem Aware customer who clearly understands his challenges with low conversion rates and high return rates in automotive e-commerce, but hasn't yet discovered that specialized product recommendation systems exist specifically for his industry. He's actively seeking solutions but doesn't know about the specific category of intelligent product advisory tools that AutoCare Advisor represents.
